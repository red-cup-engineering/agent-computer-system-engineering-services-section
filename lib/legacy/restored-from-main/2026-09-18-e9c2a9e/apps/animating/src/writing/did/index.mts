/**
 * writing/did — DIDs + Verifiable Credentials: identity UNDER WMAP.
 *
 * WMAP gave the agent an ActivityPub Actor — but an Actor `id` is a server-bound
 * IRI: it names where the agent's endpoints live, so it dies when the server does
 * (the account-portability gap the C2S memo flagged). A **DID** (Decentralized
 * Identifier, W3C) is the same identity made PORTABLE: a `did:` URI that resolves to
 * a DID document carrying the agent's public keys and its service endpoints. The
 * simplest, no-registry method — `did:web` — derives the identifier from the host +
 * path the Actor already has, so it is not a second identity at all but a re-reading
 * of the Actor's own address. `did:web:dev.bare-cedar-fog.emsenn.net:agents:sol` ⇄ the Actor at
 * `https://dev.bare-cedar-fog.emsenn.net/agents/sol`.
 *
 * A **Verifiable Credential** (W3C VC) is, for us, exactly what relating already
 * has: a CHARGED CLAIM with provenance. relating's `claim` is the `credentialSubject`
 * (what is asserted, about whom); the `charge` is the FOUR bilattice value the
 * credential carries (the issuer's truth-lean on the claim, with evidence); and the
 * `proof` is an RSA signature over the canonical credential — the provenance that
 * makes the charged claim *verifiable* rather than merely stated. We sign with the
 * exact `signRequest`/`verifyRequest` crypto the S2S brick uses (draft-cavage RSA-
 * SHA256 over a signing string), so a VC's proof is the same primitive as an HTTP
 * Signature, not a new crypto stack.
 *
 * No second ontology (the gate):
 *   - a DID is a VIEW of the Actor's `id` (host + path), not a parallel identity;
 *   - `credentialSubject` is relating's `claim` (token = who, claim = what);
 *   - the credential's value is relating's FOUR `charge` (issuer's evidenced lean);
 *   - a credential-as-capability REUSES the activitypub `Capability` carrier verbatim
 *     (issue a VC whose subject IS a `grant` — authority by a charged, signed claim
 *     that names a move), never a re-modeled permission.
 *
 * Layering: consumes only relating's stable root apex (`carrier`, `mark`, `claim`,
 * `charge`, `asChargeValue`, `ChargeValueName`) and animating's own sibling bricks
 * (the `Actor` carrier, the `signatures` crypto, the `Capability` carrier) — never a
 * relating internal subpath. This brick is a PURE VALUE LAYER: carriers plus
 * resolve/issue/verify. DID-document key rotation, status lists / revocation
 * registries, JSON-LD data-integrity proofs, and BBS+ selective disclosure are later
 * bricks — recorded as frontiers in dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-dids-vcs-as-communicating.md.
