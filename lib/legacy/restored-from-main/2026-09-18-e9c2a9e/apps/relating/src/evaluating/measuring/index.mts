/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * `@red-cup-engineering/relating/evaluating/measuring` exports Lean-grounded closure-regime
 * invariants as RMN terms.
 *
 * These reproduce abstract RelMath theorems and are golden-vectored against Lean
 * via test/fixtures/lean-measurement-golden.jsonl. Domain: `ClosureRegimeData`
 * `{ scottContinuous, finiteBase, countableCofinality }` / `ClosureRegime`.
 *
 * Product reading: measurement facts that are small enough to compute in Node
 * can still live as portable term bodies, with Lean-emitted vectors acting as
 * the oracle for the finite law surface this package actually claims.
