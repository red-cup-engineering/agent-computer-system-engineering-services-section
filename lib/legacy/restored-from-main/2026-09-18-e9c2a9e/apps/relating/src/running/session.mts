// running/session — the transfinite transport: a bounded interactive claim session.
//
// Between the Scott stream (one-sided, never conflicts) and the aperiodic open
// session (never settles) sits the transfinite-bounded session. It does NOT
// overwrite: nothing is ever retracted. Each message is a CLAIM — a charged
// predication about a cell — and the claims accumulate in a monotone log exactly
// like the Scott ledger. What moves is the JUDGEMENT: the ∨ₖ knowledge-join of all
// claims about a cell. Knowledge only grows, but the truth verdict can flip — a
// cell standing `potential` (for) becomes `stable` (⊤, both) when an `active`
// (against) claim arrives, with the earlier claim still in the log.
//
// The session is `scott` when no cell ever conflicts (flat, H¹=0) and
// `transfinite` when some cell reaches conflict (a ⊤ / NSC firing) — bounded,
// because the claim log is finite and ∨ₖ settling reaches a fixpoint. It never
// becomes aperiodic.
