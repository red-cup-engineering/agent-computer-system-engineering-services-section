/**
 * carriers - the package's validating carrier objects.
 *
 * The library (`lib/`) declares each carrier as a pure JSON-Schema literal with a bare
 * `$id` - data, no machinery. Here the runtime kernel wraps those schemas into
 * Carrier objects: it binds the structural validator and registers them in the live
 * category, so downstream faculties get `.validate`/`.assert` and can type their
 * actions by these domains and codomains. This module is the seam between the
 * static declarations and the machinery that runs claims against them.
