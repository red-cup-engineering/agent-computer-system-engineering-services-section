/**
 * messaging/cloudevents — CloudEvents as communicating's standard across-envelope.
 *
 * A CloudEvent is one charged membrane utterance in a CNCF envelope: `source`
 * names the speaker token, `type` is the Searle illocutionary force, `time` is
 * the witness time `T`, and JSON `data` carries the claim. The bridge is a
 * functorial view of `UtteranceCarrier`, not a parallel event ontology.
