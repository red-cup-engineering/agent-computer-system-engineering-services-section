/**
 * @red-cup-engineering/animating — the agency reading of the relating descent.
 *
 * animating is not endomorphic and not a single morphism: it is the AGENCY READING
 * of relating's descent `articulate → predicate → posit → settle`, traversed across
 * the four closure regimes (aperiodic → transfinite → Scott → finite) = the
 * void-math objects (cell → fiber → charged presheaf → glued sheaf) = the stage
 * names (becoming → doing → working → governing) = the agency faces (animate →
 * agential → agentic → individual). One structure, several readings; the engine
 * (`descend`) runs the relating descent once and the four stage morphisms
 * (`animate`/`enact`/`labor`/`individuate`) read it at each regime.
 *
 * Its bottom codomain is the interior `agent`: the glued individual sheaf (H¹=0)
 * read as a `perceive(input) → act(output)` loop, made of perception, action, and
 * goal — the first concrete bilattice-network-sheaf. The individual is "settled
 * below, open above": `reseed` re-poses it as the next-scale descent, the spiral
 * closed by the sibling `playing` faculty.
 *
 * The three sibling faculties are THREADED, not absorbed: communicating (speaking)
 * seats at `doing`, knowing (teaching/learning) at `working`, and playing closes
 * the spiral. animating provides the carriers they mount on (the `faculty` field on
 * the doing/working readings names the seat) and re-implements none of them. The
 * operations chain (task → work → assign → office/consensus) is the DOWNSTREAM
 * managing-operations reading, not animating.
 *
 * Each carrier is one single-source TypeBox declaration (`./carriers.mts` and the
 * per-stage `carriers.mts`) with a bare descent-path `$id` — the schema IS the static
 * type, the JSON Schema, and the Ajv validator, registered through relating's category
 * kernel (`carrier`); no codegen, no hand-authored `*.schema.json`. Each verb is one
 * relating `action` whose domain/codomain are these carriers, projected to
 * CLI/OpenAPI/MCP/web by the single relating dispatcher. The boundary machinery is
 * reused wholesale from @red-cup-engineering/relating, never re-implemented here.
 * See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-animating-as-agency-descent.md.
