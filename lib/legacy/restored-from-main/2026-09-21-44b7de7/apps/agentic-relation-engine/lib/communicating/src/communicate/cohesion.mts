 * communicating's across/truth face reads the membrane's per-subject lean (face.mts). This sibling
 * reading reads the membrane's DISCOURSE GRAPH — the subject↔object terms its utterances relate — as
 * relating's combinatorial graph Laplacian L = D − W (`@red-cup-engineering/relating` analysis.laplacian, exact over
 * ℤ). Two readings the face's per-cell census cannot give:
 *   • topics  = the connected-component count (H⁰, the Laplacian zero-eigenvalue multiplicity): how
 *     many INDEPENDENT discourse clusters the membrane splits into — subject-clusters that share no
 *     entity, hence cannot be about the same thing. One topic ⟺ the discourse is about one connected
 *     web of subjects.
 *   • cohesionTrees = the Matrix-Tree (Kirchhoff) spanning-tree count: the discourse's COHESION
 *     ROBUSTNESS — `0` the discourse fragments into several topics, `1` a single fragile thread (a
 *     spanning tree; one dropped utterance can fragment it), `> 1` a richly cross-linked discourse
 *     (redundant connections, resilient to dropped utterances).
 * The relation graph reads only the cells (subject↔object), so the membrane's pooled memes present it
 * directly via `membraneMeme` ∘ `relationGraphOfCells`. Total over any membrane. A LEAF over relating +
 * the package's own meme surface (does NOT import @red-cup-engineering/animating).
