/**
 * communicate/face — communicating's ACROSS / TRUTH local section over an agent
 * membrane, the boundary face animating (the bulk) reads instead of faking the across
 * face with a generic relating `descend`.
 *
 * animating is a holographic BULK over three boundary FACES (communicating = across,
 * knowing = inside, playing = outside; dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-bulk-over-faces-
 * local-section-threading.md). Each face is a LOCAL SECTION over the agent's membrane
 * (a `readonly UtteranceCarrier[]` log), read on one of the three transverse
 * agentive-triad bilattice axes. communicating supplies the ACROSS face on the TRUTH
 * axis (`≤_t` — which way it leans; negation antitone): the across reading is the
 * agent's settled truth-DIRECTION over its own membrane. At scale 1 the bulk is a
 * single agent over its own three faces, so this gluing is always coordination-free
 * (one self cannot contest itself across filtrations) — but the truth axis can still
 * carry a HELD contradiction when the same membrane both asserts and denies one
 * subject; that stable cell is the across face's `contested` reading.
 *
 * Crucially this is communicating's OWN meme reading, NOT a copy of animating's generic
 * descend-then-section. communicating WORKS OVER relating's meme carrier (its core morphisms are
 * meme → meme; the ≤_t semiotic structure is a description, not a definition — see
 * dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-communicating-as-end-meme-semiotics.md). The membrane is
 * settled into communicating's own MEMES — one meme per utterance, charged by its
 * truth-DIRECTION — and same-subject memes are POOLED along the bilattice so the across
 * direction reads off the pooled charge of each subject cell, not off a bare descent
 * state:
 *
 *   cover     = the distinct subject cells the membrane settles into memes (each a cell
 *               of this local section over the agent's membrane)
 *   held      = the cells whose pooled charge carries a settled truth DIRECTION
 *               (a definite potential/active lean, or a stable held-contradiction) —
 *               the cells the agent settles which way it leans
 *   contested = the cells pooled to `stable` (`⊤`) — HELD truth contradictions where
 *               the membrane both asserts and denies the SAME subject (paraconsistent,
 *               both witnesses retained) — the across face's contested cells
 *
 * The TRUTH axis enters in how a claim becomes a charge: an assertion leans `potential`
 * (positive, `≤_t`-up — `witnessedPotential`); a denial/negation leans `active`
 * (negative, `≤_t`-down) — and a denial is read by applying communicating's OWN polarity
 * involution `negate` (the meme `negate` morphism's charge operator, the truth-axis
 * antitone generator `~`) to the asserted charge. So an assertion and a denial on the
 * same subject become OPPOSED on the truth axis (negation antitone); pooling them
 * (`joinKnowledge`, the bilattice accumulation that retains both witnesses) lands on
 * `stable` — the across face's held-contradiction. Grounded in the agentive-triad's
 * truth axis (content/_archive predication-categories truth.md; Avron twist-product;
 * negation acts antitonely on `≤_t`) and communicating's own meme/negate surface.
 *
 * Dependency (the DAG): this is a LEAF over relating + the package's own meme surface.
 * It does NOT import @red-cup-engineering/animating (the bulk). animating imports THIS.
