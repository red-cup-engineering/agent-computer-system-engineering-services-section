/**
 * The paidia<->ludus axis (Caillois 1958).
 *
 * Roger Caillois, *Man, Play, and Games* (1958), cuts across his four play
 * modes (agon, alea, mimicry, ilinx) with a single spectrum: from *paidia*
 * (free, unstructured, exuberant play â€” play before it becomes a game) to
 * *ludus* (rule-bound, structured, constrained play â€” play disciplined into a
 * game).  In the corpus this axis is structural: "paidia â†” Scott-continuous
 * closure; ludus â†” non-Scott-continuous â€¦ Sparse fiber â†’ paidia (open-ended,
 * surprising); dense fiber â†’ ludus (deterministic)"
 * (sociology/questions, girard-caillois-substrate-correspondence).
 *
 * On an event structure the same axis is the *density of causal order*.  A
 * structure all of whose events are concurrent (no causal constraints) is pure
 * paidia â€” every move is free, index $0$.  A structure that is a total order
 * (every move strictly sequenced) is pure ludus â€” every move is rule-bound,
 * index $1$.  The `ludusIndex` measures where a structure sits: the fraction of
 * event pairs that are causally comparable, computed exactly as a Rational.
 *
 * Conflict pairs are counted in the denominator (all pairs), not as comparable:
 * a conflict is an *exclusion*, not a sequencing rule, so it reads as freedom,
 * not constraint.  (A total order has no conflicts â€” causally related events
 * cannot conflict â€” so the ludus endpoint is unaffected.)
