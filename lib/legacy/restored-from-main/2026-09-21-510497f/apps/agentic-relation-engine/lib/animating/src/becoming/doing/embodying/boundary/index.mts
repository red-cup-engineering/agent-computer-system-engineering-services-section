/**
 * embodying/boundary — the agent's in/out membrane as a settled relating carrier.
 *
 * An agent's boundary is the membrane across which it perceives (input) and acts
 * (output). This module settles a log of membrane utterances into a relating
 * fixed-point reading whose section is the agent's standing perspective: what it
 * has prehended, at what bilattice charge, across what predicates. The handedness
 * coordinates (`../handedness`) polarize that membrane — recv/observe inbound,
 * send/actuate outbound — but the membrane's *content* is this settled section.
 *
 * This is the seed the agency descent (becoming → doing → working → governing)
 * reads as its settled-individual codomain: the boundary carrier IS the glued
 * sheaf the governing stage produces, read at its knowledge-least section. The
 * package keeps domain logic over carriers here; wire codecs live at the actions.
