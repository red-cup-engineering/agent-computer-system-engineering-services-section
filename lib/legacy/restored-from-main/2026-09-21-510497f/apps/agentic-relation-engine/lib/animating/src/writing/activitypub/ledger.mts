/**
 * writing/activitypub/ledger — the WitnessJournal functor: an agent's outbox IS its witness log.
 *
 * This is the load-bearing claim of the WitnessJournal note made into code: a `log` of EAVT
 * witnesses (relating's witness ledger) and an `outbox` of AS2 Activities (WMAP's
 * across face) are two CHANNEL-CODES of one information source. This module is the
 * functor `F: Activity → EAVT witness` (`activityCell`) and its inverse
 * `G: witness → Activity` (`activityFromCell`); the isomorphism laws — round-trip,
 * surprisal-dedup, ⊤-preservation, and the bulk merge-square — are pinned in
 * test/witness-journal-outbox-iso.test.mjs.
 *
 * No second ontology: `F` reuses the existing utterance bridge verbatim
 * (`utteranceFromActivity` / `activityFromUtterance`). The ONLY thing the EAVT form
 * adds is carrying the activity's `published` time in the witness slot `T` — the one
 * bit the bare utterance bridge forgets. So the log is simply the bridge, with time.
 *
 * Source/channel separation (Shannon) = the data-form/wire-form split: the witness
 * is the source symbol; `eavt+jsonl`-on-fs (relating's ledger store) and this AS2
 * OrderedCollection outbox are two channel codes of it. Layering: consumes only
 * relating's root apex (`utterance`/`mark`) and animating's own AP index — never a
 * relating subpath; the law test wires the functor to the real ledger machinery.
