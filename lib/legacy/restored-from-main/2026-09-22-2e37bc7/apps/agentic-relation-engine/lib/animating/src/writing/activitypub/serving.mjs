/**
 * writing/activitypub/serving — the LIVE transport for the agent's across face: the
 * ActivityPub HTTP surface, in lib (NOT in a site). Same separation as relating's
 * `running/serving`: pure routing here; the `node:http` binding (`serve`) and the
 * per-instance config live downstream (a site parameterizes this; it does not define it).
 *
 * The agent IS a perceive→act loop, and that loop's two legs are the AP endpoints:
 *   GET  {actor}            → the Actor document            (who the agent is)
 *   GET  {actor}/outbox     → the outbox OrderedCollection  (the act leg, published)
 *   GET  {actor}/inbox      → the inbox OrderedCollection   (received)
 *   POST {actor}/inbox      → accept a delivered Activity    (the perceive leg) → 202
 *   GET  /.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@host → the WebFinger JRD
 *
 * Pure: `routeActor` maps a `ServedRequest` to a `ServedResponse` and never performs
 * I/O. Folding a posted Activity into the agent is the caller's `perceiveInbox`; the
 * route acknowledges receipt (202). Responses carry `application/activity+json`.
