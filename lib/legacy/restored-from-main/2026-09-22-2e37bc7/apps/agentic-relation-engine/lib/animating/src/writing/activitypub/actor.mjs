/**
 * writing/activitypub/actor — the Actor projection: the single agent AS an
 * ActivityPub Actor. The agent's OUTWARD identity card on the social web.
 *
 * No second ontology: an Actor is a pure VIEW of the existing `Agent` carrier (the
 * glued individual sheaf). The agent's `identity` is the Actor `id`; the agent IS a
 * `perceive(input)→act(output)` loop, and that loop is exactly the Actor's
 * inbox/outbox — perceive ← inbox, act → outbox. `followers`/`following` are the
 * Actor's peer-set endpoints; at scale 1 they are endpoint IRIs only — the actual
 * membership (a camp of many Actors) is scale-2 and belongs to `organizing`'s
 * federation codec, not here.
 *
 * This is the C2S / actor-document half of ActivityPub: who the agent is and where
 * its inbox/outbox live. Delivery, signing, and the inbox/outbox COLLECTIONS are
 * separate bricks. See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-codecs-on-faces-activitypub-across-scales.md.
