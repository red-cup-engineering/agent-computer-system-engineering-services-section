/**
 * writing/activitypub — animating's ACROSS-face standards codec: the single agent
 * as an ActivityPub Actor (the Client-to-Server / object surface).
 *
 * This is the scale-1 across-face standard. animating is the bulk that glues three
 * boundary faces into one agent; the ACROSS face is `communicating` (meme in / meme
 * out over the agent's membrane). ActivityPub is the standardized wire for exactly
 * that face: an Actor receives Activities at its inbox (perceive) and emits them
 * from its outbox (act). So an ActivityStreams `Activity` is, for us, ONE membrane
 * utterance crossing the boundary — and this codec is the pure value↔wire bridge
 * between the two, NOT a second ontology.
 *
 * No second ontology (the gate): an inbound `Activity` becomes a relating
 * `UtteranceCarrier` — the exact carrier the agent's membrane is made of and the
 * `communicating` across face (`membraneMeme`/`communicatingFace`) already reads —
 * with `actor` as the token (who) and the activity's object content as the claim
 * (what). An outbound utterance becomes an `Activity` the same way. Charge/polarity
 * (assertion vs. `Undo` = denial) is the across face's truth-axis reading; this
 * brick supplies the object bridge, leaving the truth-direction to `communicating`.
 *
 * Layering: this consumes only relating's stable root apex (`mark`, `utterance`,
 * `UtteranceCarrier`, `carrier`) — never a relating subpath — and is downstream of
 * the `communicating` across face. The Actor projection (Actor = the agent), the
 * inbox/outbox collections, and S2S federation are separate bricks; federation
 * (many Actors) is scale-2 and belongs to `organizing`, not here.
 * See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-codecs-on-faces-activitypub-across-scales.md.
