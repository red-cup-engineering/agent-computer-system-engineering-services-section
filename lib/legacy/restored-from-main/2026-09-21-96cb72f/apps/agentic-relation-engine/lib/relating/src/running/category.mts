/**

 *
 * running/category — the morphism half of the single-source category kernel.
 *
 * A carrier (the object half) lives in `src/carriers`. This module adds the
 * MORPHISM half: actions typed by carrier domain/codomain objects, the live action
 * registry, and composition as the carrier identity equation
 * (`producer.codomain.id === consumer.domain.id`). The categorical role split is
 * objects→writing, morphisms→running; the morphism half imports the object half
 * (running already depends on writing), and the dependency is acyclic — writing
 * never imports running.
 *
 * `registeredCategory` composes the carrier registry (writing) with this module's
 * action registry into one `CategoryRegistry` so downstream faculties populate a
 * single live category by declaring carriers and actions.
