// running/transport-work — each transport's work-type, read through the σ×Δ quartet.
//
// A transport is a unit of work; its kind fixes the two skillful-work nuclei —
// σ (meaning-closure: is the output type settled?) and Δ (execution-closure: is the
// path settled, no branch?). The four transports are the four work types: a
// request/response serve names its codomain but dispatches (σ, ¬Δ — Procedure); an
// SSE feed is typed and deterministic (σ, Δ — Process); a settled claim session
// derives a judgement without branching (¬σ, Δ — Derivation); an open or conflicted
// session infers and branches (¬σ, ¬Δ — Inquiry).
//
// This is the transport-site instance of the recurring FOUR; the agent-site sibling
// is `@red-cup-engineering/agentic-animation-engine`'s `classifySkillfulWork`. The determination charge is
// relating's own ≤ₖ join, never re-authored.
