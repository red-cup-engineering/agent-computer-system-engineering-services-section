/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The package's registered operations, each a cocone leg.
 *
 * These are the relating morphisms presented at the boundary. `induceBins` over
 * this list assembles the discovery apex; the `relate` dispatcher runs any of
 * them. None of these files binds stdin or argv — the dispatcher owns that, once.
 *
 * Articulation and predication consume their predecessor's carrier. Positing
 * additionally admits charge evidence, and settling requires a closure profile;
 * the full descent admits all three inputs in one JSON carrier.
 *
 * The list also carries the package's introspection surface. `morphismCarrier`
 * serializes an action declaration without its executable closure; the `inspect`
 * action reads that morphism carrier and reports whether its RMN body is present,
 * closed, how large it is, and which term constructors it uses. That is deliberately
 * a boundary read today: it inspects host-level metadata about the term object
 * rather than claiming to be a pure carrier morphism in RMN.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { actions, induceBins, morphismCarrier } from "@red-cup-engineering/agentic-relation-engine";
 *
 * const apex = induceBins(actions, { packageName: "@red-cup-engineering/agentic-relation-engine" });
 * const conflate = actions.find((action) => action.verb === "conflate-charge");
 * const report = apex.dispatch(["inspect"], JSON.stringify(morphismCarrier(conflate)));
 * JSON.parse(report.stdout).termUses; // ["conflate", "lam", "var"]
 * ```
