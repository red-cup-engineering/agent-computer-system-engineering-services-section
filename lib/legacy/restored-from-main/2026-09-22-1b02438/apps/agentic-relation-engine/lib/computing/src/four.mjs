 * four — FOUR, the external settled-truth structure of a computational predicate.

 * bilattice points: verified (t), refuted (f), undecidable (⊥ — the value Rice's
 * theorem forces for every non-trivial behavioural predicate), contradictory (⊤).
 * This is relating's bilattice FOUR read computationally; the correspondence to
 * relating's charge values is potential↔t, active↔f, absurd↔⊥, stable↔⊤.
