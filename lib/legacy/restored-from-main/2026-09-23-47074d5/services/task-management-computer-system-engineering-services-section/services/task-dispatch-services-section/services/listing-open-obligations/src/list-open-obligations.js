/**
 * @skill listing-open-obligations
 * @verb-phrase listing open obligations
 * @closure-kind process
 * @description Reads the dispatch board and derives which dispatches are OPEN — a dispatch is open while its task's goal is unachieved, achievement derived by re-running the goal (make-a-task.js --verify), never read from any record. Given an office, reads only that office's board; given nothing, the whole board. Use at session start to learn what an office owes, and any time the question is what work is outstanding — the answer is executed, not remembered. This is the published owner of the office/duty toolkit's obligations query — every office consumes it here rather than carrying its own copy.
 *
 * @precondition every seated dispatch names a task that seats in the tasks pool
 * @precondition an office argument, when given, seats in a roster somewhere in the tree
 * @postcondition every dispatch on the queried board is reported exactly once, open or settled
 * @postcondition openness was derived by re-running each task's goal, and read from no record
 * @witness each dispatch queried, its task, its office, and the goal conditions still in the gap
 * @witness on contradiction, the dispatch whose task seats nowhere, named rather than skipped
 *
 * The board is the truth because nobody wrote it down.
 *
 * A dispatch record names a task and an office, and nothing else — no status,
 * no open key, no closed key. So the only way to know what is outstanding is
 * to ask the goals, and that is this script: for every dispatch (or every
 * dispatch to one office), re-run the dispatched task's goal and report the
 * dispatch OPEN where the goal is unachieved. Achievement is derived by
 * `make-a-task.js --verify` — the one derivation, called and never copied —
 * so this query and the witness's instrument can never disagree.
 *
 * Slower than reading a status field, on every occasion. That is the cost of
 * a board that cannot drift: a status field is the worker's memory of the
 * work, and this is the work, asked directly.
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * node .../list-open-obligations.js                    # the whole board
 * node .../list-open-obligations.js <office>           # one office's board
 * node .../list-open-obligations.js --pool <enterprise>/dispatches --task-pool <enterprise>/tasks
 * ```
 *
 * `--pool` names the dispatch board and `--task-pool` the tasks pool the
 * derivation runs against — absent, both fall back to the emsenn enterprise's,
 * so a foreign enterprise's board names its own pools or reads the wrong ones.
 *
 * Output is JSON: every dispatch on the queried board, `open` (with the gap —
 * the goal conditions that did not settle) or `settled`. Exits 0 when the
 * query ran whole, 1 on a contradiction — a dispatch naming a task that
 * seats nowhere, or an office argument that seats in no roster.
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not to close a dispatch. Nothing closes a dispatch; the goal settling
 *   closes it, and this only reports that it has.
 * - Not as the worker's proof its own work is done. The same rule as
 *   --verify, whose readout this carries: a worker running it on itself
 *   proves nothing. Attestation belongs to attesting-a-work-product.
 * - Not to decide what to work first. The board is a board, not a queue;
 *   ordering the work is the incumbent's judgment at the board.
