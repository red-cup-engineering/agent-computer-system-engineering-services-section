 * computation — compute's codomain carrier, declared as a plain JSON-Schema literal (no TypeBox, no
 * codegen, no Ajv). The `as const` schema is the single source: `FromSchema` infers the type and
 * `schemaFrom` builds the structural validator + registers the `$id`. This carrier exercises BOTH
 * `$ref` cases: a cross-package `$ref` to the @red-cup-engineering/animating agent (→ a loose `unknown` slot at the
 * type level; validated by delegating to the registered agent carrier at runtime) and a LOCAL
 * `#/$defs/Four` (→ the resolved FOUR shape, both at type and runtime). "computation = settling": the
 * carrier embeds the settled agent and reads its FOUR truth.
