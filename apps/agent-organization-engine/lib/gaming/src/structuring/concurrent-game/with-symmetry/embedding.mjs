/**
 * The CGS embeddings realized as gaming OBJECT-MAPS into real arenas.
 *
 * `@red-cup-engineering/playing/ludics` owns the SOURCE-side algebra of the four embeddings
 * (the Dialectica object `(U, X, α)` with its `*`-autonomous dual/tensor, the
 * Caires–Pfenning `session → CLL proposition` map, and the named embedding
 * catalog). What playing deliberately does NOT realize is the codomain: the
 * arena-with-symmetry that each source object lands on, because that is the
 * multi-agent (CGS) face. As the playing embeddings module says of the Dialectica
 * map, "the realized object-map into a CGS arena … belongs to
 * @emsenn/gaming-experimental." This module is that realization — it consumes the
 * imported source algebra and produces gaming `Arena`s (and, for the CLL reading,
 * the proposition naming a behaviour), reusing playing's source maps verbatim.
 *
 * The transformer realized here is the object component of
 *   F : Dial(Eff) → CGS
 * (content/_archive …/computing/code/transformers/f-dial-to-cgs.md): an object
 * `(U, X, α)` maps to the concurrent game arena with P-events `U`, O-events `X`,
 * TRIVIAL causality (all events concurrent), intra-polarity conflict
 * (`u # u'` for `u ≠ u'`, `x # x'` for `x ≠ x'`), NO cross P–O conflict, and the
 * TRIVIAL symmetry groupoid (`discreteArena`). The functor preserves the
 * `*`-autonomous structure on the nose: `F(A^⊥) = (FA)^⊥` (the polarity swap of
 * the Dialectica dual) and `F(A ⊗ B) = FA ‖ FB` (the Dialectica tensor maps to
 * parallel composition), both of which fall out of the source algebra
 * (`dualDialectica`/`tensorDialectica`) composed with this object-map.
