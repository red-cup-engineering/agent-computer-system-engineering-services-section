/**
 * Concurrent strategies — the morphisms of $\mathbf{CGS}$.
 *
 * A morphism $A \to B$ is an equivalence class of concurrent strategies
 * $\sigma : S \to A^\perp \| B$ satisfying, per Castellan-Clairambault-Winskel,
 * three conditions: *receptivity*, *innocence*, and *symmetry-invariance*.  We
 * present a strategy on a single arena as a non-empty, prefix-closed set of
 * valid plays and supply a witness/obstruction judge for each condition:
 *
 *   - **receptivity** — Player may not refuse Opponent: any negative move the
 *     arena legally enables after an admitted play is itself admitted.
 *   - **innocence** — the deterministic (Hyland-Ong) reading the corpus gives:
 *     "sequential innocent strategies are the deterministic concurrent
 *     strategies — at most one P-move enabled after any history."
 *   - **symmetry-invariance** — *the defining condition*: the admitted set is
 *     **closed under the arena symmetry-groupoid action**.  A symmetry of the
 *     arena acts on a play by relabeling each move along the bijection (and, at
 *     the nominal layer, the bijection is itself induced by an
 *     $\mathrm{FSym}(\mathbb{A})$ finite name permutation via
 *     `applyPermutation`); a *concurrent strategy* is exactly a play-set fixed
 *     by every symmetry in the groupoid.  `closeUnderSymmetry` is the closure
 *     operator that produces this fixed set; `symmetryInvarianceJudgment`
 *     witnesses it.  This is the lift datum: gaming is **playing lifted along
 *     the symmetry groupoid** — `strategyFromDesign` admits a playing `Design`'s
 *     chronicles as plays and closes them under the groupoid; at trivial
 *     symmetry that closure is the identity and the strategy coincides with the
 *     playing `Design` (the trivial-symmetry inclusion `playing ↪ gaming`).
