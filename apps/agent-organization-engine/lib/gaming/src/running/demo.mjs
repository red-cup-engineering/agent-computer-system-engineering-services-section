/**
 * demo — named demo arenas, so a game can be created without hand-authoring an

 *
 * Per the corpus, "the theory of computing is $\mathbf{CGS}$" (concurrent games
 * with symmetry): an arena is a *polarized prime event structure with a symmetry
 * groupoid* — the board on which Player and Opponent move.  These demos are
 * nothing new: each is a configuration of the `@red-cup-engineering/gaming`
 * constructors (`event`, `eventStructure`, `arena`, `discreteArena`) with
 * polarities drawn from the Belnap reading (positive = potential, negative =
 * active).  The `game` scripts and the server both offer them by name so a
 * running game can be minted from a single token.
