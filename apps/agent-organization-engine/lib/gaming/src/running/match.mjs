/**
 * Match — the joint N-player interaction of a whole roster of designs.
 *
 * A running game is multi-agent: N enrolled designs play concurrently over one
 * shared arena.  The corpus names this exactly.  Per
 * `federation-is-parallel-composition.md`, $\mathbf{CGS}$'s monoidal product
 * $\|$ IS parallel composition of arenas — "$A\|B$ is the arena where Player
 * makes moves in both $A$ and $B$ concurrently," i.e. concurrent multi-player —
 * and "the cellwise $\vee_k$-join followed by closure is the action induced by
 * $\|$ at the fiber level."  So the JOINT interaction of the whole roster over
 * the shared arena is the $\|$-combine = the iterated knowledge-join $\bigsqcup_k$
 * = exactly playing/ludics's `superpose` (the $\sqcup_k$ union of commitments,
 * re-exported by gaming via the with-symmetry barrel from `@red-cup-engineering/playing/ludics`).
 *
 * `matchAll` folds over ALL designs — `jointForm = superpose(designs)` is the
 * $\|$-combine over the WHOLE roster, not a privileged pair.  Because
 * $\sqcup_k$ is commutative, associative, and idempotent, `superpose` is
 * order-independent: the joint match is invariant under any permutation of the
 * players — the $\mathrm{FSym}(\mathbb{A})$ groupoid that permutes agents acts
 * trivially on the verdict.  That symmetry-invariance is the multi-agent
 * structure the spiral note names, gotten for free from the fold.
 *
 * Convergence is read at the fiber level: a Daimon collision is a locus where
 * the knowledge-join is stable $\top$ — a shared/meeting locus at which the
 * cellwise $\vee_k$ has closed against the Daimon $\dagger$.  We read it off the
 * joint form by `interactionReport(jointForm, jointForm)`: since
 * $x \sqcup_k x = x$, a self-interaction's `daimonLoci` are exactly the loci of
 * `jointForm` already at $\top$ — the loci where the N-way join collided.  This
 * reuses `interactionReport` / `convergenceJudgment` verbatim; nothing new is
 * invented.
