/**
 * genre — the synthesis object of the affect/dramaturgy frontier (first cut): GENRE = behaviour ×
 * affect-arc, with Berlant's IMPASSE as its pathology (dev/docs/notes in @red-cup-engineering/gaming,
 * 2026-06-25-affect-and-dramaturgy-in-play.md).
 *
 * A genre is two things at once. FORMALLY it is a behaviour — the set of plays that "count" within a
 * frame (in full ludics, designs closed under bi-orthogonality; here, a set of chronicles, each a
 * sanctioned play of the genre). AFFECTIVELY it is Berlant's genre (Cruel Optimism, 2011): a promised
 * FEELING-ARC, an expectation of how the affect of a play will move from opening to close
 * (tension→release, escalation→catharsis, …). The killer case is the IMPASSE — Berlant's genre of
 * stuckness — a genre in which NO play resolves: every chronicle ends in a Daimon (give-up), never at a
 * played-out leaf. That is cruel optimism formalized: a frame you keep playing because it lets you
 * neither win nor leave, only surrender-and-continue.
 *
 * Reads the affect-arc with `playAffect` (./affect.mts) over the genre's chronicles; consumes nothing
 * else. A chronicle resolves iff it ends at a leaf (its last action is not the Daimon).
