/**
 * factoring — the agentive-triad act-factorization, the THIRD reading of the descent.
 *
 * The one relating descent already reads two ways: as the four closure regimes
 * (becoming → doing → working → governing) and as the agency faces. This module adds
 * the corpus's third reading: the Austin/Searle **locution / illocution /
 * perlocution** three-layer factorization of an agentive act (content/_archive
 * speaking/{locution,illocution,perlocution}.md):
 *   - LOCUTION = *what is said* — the content SELECTED, prior to any force; "the
 *     selecting step: it changes nothing yet, it only fixes where a force will land."
 *   - ILLOCUTION = *what is done in saying* — the FORCE valued onto that content
 *     (asserted / denied); conventional, fixed by the act-type.
 *   - PERLOCUTION = *what is brought about by saying* — the EFFECT, the standing
 *     contribution left in the shared field; NOT conventional — it depends on the
 *     actual UPTAKE (the closure that actually settled), running out beyond the act.
 *
 * Crucially `factor` no longer FAKES the three faces with one generic descend section.
 * It consolidates each from its sibling faculty's OWN face reading (the bulk → faces
 * threading; dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-bulk-over-faces-local-section-threading.md):
 * communicating reads its memes (truth ≤_t), knowing its comonad context (knowledge
 * ≤_k), playing its Design (evidence ⟨a₊,a₋⟩). The L/I/P is that face's own settling
 * FUNNEL — locution = the membrane's locutionary acts (raw utterances selecting
 * content) ⊇ illocution = the distinct valued cells (the force-bearing memes/cells/
 * loci, the face's `cover`) ⊇ perlocution = the cells that took settled effect (the
 * face's `held` standing, the uptake into the shared field) — and `belnap` is the
 * face's OWN axis-typed FOUR census, NOT a generic section count. The face↔axis map
 * (communicating↔truth, knowing↔knowledge, playing↔evidence) is provisional.
