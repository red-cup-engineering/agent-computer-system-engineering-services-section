# Relating Developer Docs

These docs are for maintainers changing `@red-cup-engineering/agentic-relation-engine` itself.

- [Architecture](architecture.md) describes the package layers and their ownership.
- [CI](ci.md) records the current GitHub Actions setup.
- [TypeDoc](typedoc.md) records how API docs are generated and what warning policy is currently intentional.
- [Product shape](product-shape.md) names the product-shaped surfaces already present in code and downstream usage without overstating the frontier.
- [Derived tests and examples obligations](derived-tests-and-examples-obligations.md) defines what `test/` and `examples/` must prove or demonstrate from relational Hoare triples, including the deep codec test grammar.
- [ADR: acting, running, and holography](../../../../../../../../../../../../../science-services-section/services/engineering-science-services-section/services/computer-science-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/06/25/2026-06-25-acting-and-holography.md) captures the current placement of the public running surface.
- [notes/2026-06-24-term-ir-subsystem.md](../../../../../../../../../../../../../science-services-section/services/engineering-science-services-section/services/computer-science-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/06/24/2026-06-24-term-ir-subsystem.md) is the deeper term-IR subsystem note.
- [notes/2026-06-25-diataxis-learning-frontier.md](../../../../../../../../../../../../../science-services-section/services/engineering-science-services-section/services/computer-science-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/06/25/2026-06-25-diataxis-learning-frontier.md) records the Diataxis/learning closure frontier without presenting it as a shipped package feature.
- [notes/2026-06-25-relation-capability-faculty-face-bulk.md](notes/2026-06-25-relation-capability-faculty-face-bulk.md) derives the full chain from predication primitives to the holographic bulk: relation → capability → faculty → face → edge → bulk/boundary.
- [notes/2026-06-23-sloppy-relation-model-notation-spec.md](../../../../../../../../../../../../../science-services-section/services/engineering-science-services-section/services/computer-science-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/06/23/2026-06-23-sloppy-relation-model-notation-spec.md) preserves the earlier RMN specification work.

Maintenance rule: keep source JSDoc and TypeDoc closest to the machine contract, then user docs, then these developer notes.
When they disagree, fix the farther document or the code; do not let prose drift away from the export map.
