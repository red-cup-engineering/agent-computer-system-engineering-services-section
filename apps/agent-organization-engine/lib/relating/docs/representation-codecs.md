# Representation Codecs

The codec surface is the package's representation boundary kit.
It admits values into wire/document forms, canonicalizes them where order should not matter, and projects selected representations through holography projectors.

This is not the package ontology.
Carriers, actions, predication cells, charges, and settlements are the ontology.
Codecs are the gates where those things cross JSON, JSONL, Markdown, TOML, Turtle, HTML/XML/SVG, paths, schemas, and HTTP header grammars.

Useful handles:

- canonical JSON: `canonical`, `parseJson`, `jsonProjector`, `jsonlProjector`
- EAVT/object rows: `toEavt`, `mergeEavtLogs`, `unfoldJson`, `foldJson`
- schema traces: `unfoldSchema`, `projectSchemaAssertions`, `resolveJsonPointer`
- markdown cuts: `createMarkdown`, `markdownDataform`, `markdownProjector`
- text/RDF boundaries: `escapeText`, `escapeAttr`, `slug`, `iriRef`, `turtleLiteral`
- HTTP boundaries: `parseContentType`, `negotiateType`, `cacheControl`, `parseRange`, `parseCookieHeader`, `sseEventFrame`, `mcpOk`
- RMN executable documents: `rmnProjector`, `htmlIsRelational`, `settleRelationalHtml`, `sessionIsRelational`
- SVG/radial projection: `projectSvg`, `projectRadial`, `radialProjector`, `radialFromValuation`, `radialFromClosureStages`

## Example

```js
import { charge, chargeValue } from "@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine";
import { canonical } from "@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine/codecs/text/json";
import { projectRadial } from "@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine/codecs/text/xml/svg/radial";

canonical({ b: 2, a: 1 }); // "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}"

const supported = charge(chargeValue("potential"));

const svg = projectRadial({
  rings: [{
    ordinal: 0,
    segments: [{
      e: "json",
      a: "canonicalizes",
      v: "bytes",
      orbit: "diagonal",
      charge: supported,
    }],
  }],
});
```

## Product Reading

Most Node libraries treat codecs as glue: parse here, stringify there, hope the bytes are close enough.
In `@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine`, codecs are closer to boundary witnesses.
They answer:

- can this value inhabit this representation?
- are these bytes canonical for this JSON value?
- can this document be unfolded into trace rows and folded back?
- can this HTTP field value be read as a pure representation choice?
- can this SVG be recognized as the radial projection vocabulary?
- can this HTML document carry RMN script bodies without admitting JavaScript?
- can a representation be mounted as a holography projector?

That is a real product surface because downstream packages can reuse the same representation laws instead of reauthoring small, drifting codecs.

## Verification Reading

The codec tests cover observable behavior rather than private implementation shape:

- canonical JSON is key-order independent and idempotent
- TOML decodes and encodes a value tree
- Turtle and markup escaping neutralize representation syntax
- EAVT/datom folds hold contradictions as FOUR-valued charge instead of erasing them
- HTTP codecs parse and serialize field values without owning a server adapter
- relational HTML admits only RMN script bodies and rejects JavaScript or plain data pretending to be executable content
- radial SVG projection is deterministic, self-describing, charge-colored, and recognized by `radialProjector`

This is standards-facing engineering, not a Lean-conformance surface.
The authority here is the representation contract and the package tests.
