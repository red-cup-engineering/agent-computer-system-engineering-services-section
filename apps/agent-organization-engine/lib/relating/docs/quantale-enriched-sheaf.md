# Quantale-Enriched Sheaf

`analysis.quantaleEnrichedSheaf` is the finite executable surface for `RelMath.
Cohomology.
QuantaleEnrichedSheaf`.

It models:

- the concrete FOUR/Charge quantale;
- knowledge order as the quantale order;
- knowledge meet as multiplication;
- `stable` as the multiplicative unit;
- knowledge join over finite subsets as the supremum;
- exhaustive finite quantale law receipts;
- finite Q-category carriers and hom tables;
- finite Q-functors and composition;
- q-fuzzy equivalence grade multiplication;
- the `q = 1` strict-equivalence shadow;
- degree-0 enriched cohomology as Laplacian fixed points;
- root RMN normalization at `quantaleEnrichedSheaf.receipt`.

```js
import { evaluateRunTerm, quantaleEnrichedSheaf } from "@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine";
import * as analysis from "@red-cup-engineering/agent-organization-engine/analysis";

const receipt = analysis.quantaleEnrichedSheaf.receipt();

receipt.quantale.one;
// "stable"

analysis.quantaleEnrichedSheaf.mul("potential", "active");
// "absurd"

evaluateRunTerm(quantaleEnrichedSheaf.receipt, receipt);
// the same receipt
```

The runtime surface is finite.
Arbitrary complete quantales, non-finite Q-categories, and full enriched Cech cohomology over arbitrary sites remain Lean/proof-side obligations.
